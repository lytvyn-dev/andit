                    II. General information on data processing <br>
                    1. Scope of processing personal data</p>
                <p>As a matter of principle, we process the personal data of our users only insofar as this is necessary
                    for the provision of a functional website as well as our contents and services. The processing of
                    personal data of our users is regularly only carried out with the consent of the user. An exception
                    applies in those cases in which it is not possible to obtain prior consent for actual reasons and
                    the processing of the data is permitted by legal regulations. <br>
                    2. Legal basis for the processing of personal data</p>
                <p>Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing operations involving personal
                    data, Article 6 (1) (a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal
                    basis.</p>
                <p>When processing personal data that is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data
                    subject is a party, Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing
                    operations that are necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures. <br>
                    Insofar as the processing of personal data is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation to
                    which our company is subject, Art. 6 (1) c DSGVO serves as the legal basis.</p>
                <p>In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person make processing of
                    personal data necessary, Art. 6 (1) (d) DSGVO serves as the legal basis.</p>
                <p>If the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third-party and
                    the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the
                    first-mentioned interest, Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO serves as the legal basis for the processing. <br>
                    3. Data deletion and storage period</p>
                <p>The personal data of the data subject will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage
                    ceases to apply. Storage may also take place if this has been provided for by the European or
                    national legislator in Union regulations, laws, or other provisions to which the controller is
                    subject. Data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned
                    standards expires unless there is a necessity for the continued storage of the data for the
                    conclusion or fulfillment of a contract. <br>
                    III. Provision of the website and creation of log files <br>
                    1. Description and scope of data processing</p>
                <p>Each time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the
                    computer system of the accessing computer.</p>
                <p>
                    The following data is collected:</p>
                <p>(1) Name and URL of the retrieved file, date and time of retrieval <br>
                    (2) amount of data transferred <br>
                    (3) notification of successful retrieval (HTTP response code) <br>
                    (4) browser type, operating system <br>
                    (5) Internet service provider of the user <br>
                    (6) IP address in a shortened form and the requesting provider (no clear assignment possible) <br>
                    (7) information on the number of times the website is accessed.</p>
                <p>This data is also stored in the log files of our system. This data is not stored together with other
                    personal data of the user. <br>
                    2. Legal basis for data processing</p>
                <p> The legal basis for the temporary storage of the data and the log files is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f
                    DSGVO. <br>
                    3. Purpose of data processing</p>
                <p> The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to enable the delivery of the
                    website to the user’s computer. For this purpose, the user’s IP address must remain stored for the
                    duration of the session.</p>
                <p>The storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, we use the
                    data to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. An
                    evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.</p>
                <p>These purposes are also our legitimate interest in data processing according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f
                    DSGVO. <br>
                    4. Duration of storage</p>
                <p>The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required to achieve the purpose for which it was
                    collected. In the case of the collection of data for the provision of the website, this is the case
                    when the respective session has ended.</p>
                <p>In the case of storage of data in log files, this is the case after seven days at the latest. Storage
                    beyond this period is possible. In this case, the IP addresses of the users are deleted or alienated
                    so that an assignment of the calling client is no longer possible. <br>
                    5. Possibility of objection and removal</p>
                <p>The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in log files is
                    absolutely necessary for the operation of the website. Consequently, there is no possibility for the
                    user to object. <br>
                    IV. Use of cookies <br>
                    1. Description and scope of data processing</p>

                <p>The legal basis for the processing of data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO if the user has given his
                    consent. <br>
                    3. Legal basis for data processing</p>
                <p>The purpose of using technically necessary cookies is to simplify the use of websites for users. Some
                    functions of our website cannot be offered without the use of cookies. For these, it is necessary
                    that the browser is recognized even after a page change.</p>
                <p>We require cookies for the following applications: In order for the website to be output in a
                    language mastered by the user, the language setting selected is stored. This is stored with the help
                    of the cookie.</p>
                <p>The user data collected by technically necessary cookies are not used to create user profiles.</p>
                <p>These purposes are also our legitimate interest in processing the personal data in accordance with
                    Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. <br>
                    4. Duration of storage, possibility of objection and removal</p>
                <p>Cookies are stored on the user’s computer and transmitted from it to our site. Therefore, you as a
                    user also have full control over the use of cookies. By changing the settings in your internet
                    browser, you can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies. Cookies that have already been
                    stored can be deleted at any time.</p>
                <p>This can also be done automatically. If cookies are deactivated for our website, it may no longer be
                    possible to use all the functions of the website to their full extent. When the browser is closed,
                    the data is deleted. <br>
                    V. E-mail contact <br>
                    1. Description and scope of data processing</p>
                <p>It is possible to contact us via the e-mail address provided. In this case, the user’s personal data
                    transmitted with the e-mail will be stored.</p>
                <p>In this context, the data is not passed on to third parties. The data is used exclusively for
                    processing the conversation. <br>
                    2. Legal basis for data processing</p>
                <p>The legal basis for the processing of the data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO if the user has given
                    his consent.</p>
                <p>The legal basis for the processing of data transmitted in the course of sending an e-mail is Art. 6
                    para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. <br>
                    3. Purpose of data processing</p>
                <p>The processing of the personal data from the input mask serves us solely to process the contact. In
                    the case of contact by e-mail, this also constitutes the necessary legitimate interest in processing
                    the data.</p>
                <p>The other personal data processed during the sending process serve to prevent misuse of the contact
                    form and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. <br>
                    4. Duration of storage</p>
                <p>The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required to achieve the purpose for which it was
                    collected. For the personal data from the input mask of the contact form and those sent by e-mail,
                    this is the case when the respective conversation with the user has ended. The conversation is ended
                    when the circumstances indicate that the matter in question has been conclusively clarified.</p>
                <p>The additional personal data collected during the sending process is deleted after a period of seven
                    days at the latest. <br>
                    5. Possibility of objection and removal</p>
                <p>The user has the option of revoking his or her consent to the processing of personal data at any
                    time. If the user contacts us by e-mail, he can object to the storage of his personal data at any
                    time. In such a case, the conversation cannot be continued.</p>
                <p>The revocation of consent and the objection to storage can be initiated at any time by e-mail or by
                    telephone to the person responsible named under I. as well as via the contact data mentioned on the
                    website (info@abit.io).</p>
                <p>All personal data stored in the course of contacting us will be deleted in this case. <br>
                    VI. Rights of the data subject</p>
                <p>If personal data is processed by you, you are a data subject within the meaning of the GDPR, and you
                    are entitled to the following rights vis-à-vis the controller: <br>
                    1. Right of providing information</p>
                <p>You may request confirmation from the controller as to whether personal data concerning you is being
                    processed by us.</p>
                <p>If there is such processing, you may request information from the controller about the following:</p>
                <p>(1) the purposes for which the personal data are processed; <br>
                    (2) the categories of personal data which are processed; <br>
                    (3) the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data concerning you have been or
                    will be disclosed; <br>
                    (4) the envisaged duration of the storage of the personal data concerning you or, if specific
                    information on this is not possible, criteria for determining the storage period; <br>
                    (5) the existence of a right to obtain the rectification or erasure of personal data concerning you,
                    a right to obtain the restriction of processing by the controller or a right to object to such
                    processing; <br>
                    (6) the existence of a right of appeal to a supervisory authority; <br>
                    (7) any available information on the origin of the data, if the personal data are not collected from
                    the data subject; <br>
                    (8) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, pursuant to Article 22(1) and
                    (4) of the GDPR and, at least in these cases, meaningful information about the logic involved and
                    the scope and intended effects of such processing for the data subject.</p>
                <p>You have the right to request information on whether personal data concerning you are transferred to
                    a third country or to an international organization. In this context, you may request to be informed
                    about the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 of the GDPR in connection with the transfer.
                </p>
                <p>This right of access may be limited to the extent that it is likely to render impossible or seriously
                    impair the achievement of the research or statistical purposes and the limitation is necessary for
                    the fulfillment of the research or statistical purposes. <br>
                    2. Right to rectification</p>
                <p>You have a right to rectification and/or completion against the controller if the personal data
                    processed concerning you is inaccurate or incomplete. The controller must make the rectification
                    without undue delay.</p>
                <p>Your right to rectification may be limited to the extent that it is likely to make impossible or
                    seriously prejudice the achievement of the research or statistical purposes and the limitation is
                    necessary for the fulfillment of the research or statistical purposes. <br>
                    3. Right to restriction of processing</p>
                <p>You may request the restriction of the processing of personal data relating to you under the
                    following conditions:</p>
                <p>(1) if you contest the accuracy of the personal data concerning you for a period enabling the
                    controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data; <br>
                    (2) the processing is unlawful and you object to the erasure of the personal data and request
                    instead of the restriction of the use of the personal data; <br>
                    (3) the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing but you need
                    it for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; or <br>
                    (4) if you have objected to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) DSGVO and it is not yet clear
                    whether the controller’s legitimate grounds override your grounds.</p>
                <p>Where the processing of personal data relating to you has been restricted, such data may only be
                    processed – apart from being stored – with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or
                    defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or
                    for reasons of substantial public interest of the Union or a Member State.</p>
                <p>If the restriction of processing has been restricted in accordance with the above conditions, you
                    will be informed by the controller before the restriction is lifted.</p>
                <p>Your right to restriction of processing may be limited to the extent that it is likely to make
                    impossible or seriously impede the achievement of the research or statistical purposes and the
                    restriction is necessary for the fulfillment of the research or statistical purposes. <br>
                    4. Right to erasure <br>
                    a) Obligation to erase</p>
                <p>You may request the data controller to erase the personal data concerning you without undue delay and
                    the data controller is obliged to erase such data without undue delay if one of the following
                    reasons applies:</p>
                <p>(1) The personal data concerning you are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were
                    collected or otherwise processed. <br>
                    (2) You withdraw your consent on which the processing was based pursuant to Art. 6 (1) a or Art. 9
                    (2) a DSGVO and there is no other legal basis for the processing. <br>
                    (3) You object to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding
                    legitimate grounds for the processing, or you object to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of
                    the GDPR. <br>
                    (4) The personal data concerning you have been processed unlawfully. <br>
                    (5) The erasure of the personal data concerning you is necessary for compliance with a legal
                    obligation under Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject. <br>
                    (6) The personal data concerning you has been collected in relation to information society services
                    offered pursuant to Article 8(1) DSGVO. <br>
                    b) Information to third parties</p>
                <p>If the controller has made the personal data concerning you public and is obliged to erase it
                    pursuant to Article 17(1) of the GDPR, it shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures,
                    having regard to the available technology and the cost of implementation, to inform data controllers
                    that process the personal data that you, as the data subject, have requested them to erase all links
                    to, or copies or replications of, that personal data. <br>
                    c) Exceptions</p>
                <p>The right to erasure does not apply insofar as the processing is necessary.</p>
                <p>(1) for the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information; <br>
                    (2) for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing under Union or Member State law
                    to which the controller is subject, or for the performance of a task carried out in the public
                    interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; <br>
                    (3) for reasons of public interest in the area of public health pursuant to Article 9(2)(h) and (i)
                    and Article 9(3) of the GDPR; <br>
                    (4) for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
                    statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, insofar as the right referred to in
                    section (a) is likely to render impossible or seriously prejudice the achievement of the purposes of
                    such processing; or <br>
                    (5) for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims. <br>
                    5. Right to information</p>
                <p>If you have exercised the right to rectification, erasure, or restriction of processing against the
                    controller, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom the personal data concerning
                    you have been disclosed of this rectification or erasure of the data or restriction of processing,
                    unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.</p>
                <p>You have the right to be informed of these recipients by the controller. <br>
                    6. Right to data portability</p>
                <p>You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that you have provided to the
                    controller in a structured, common, and machine-readable format. You also have the right to transmit
                    this data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to whom the personal data has
                    been provided, provided that</p>
                <p>(1) the processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO or Art. 9 para. 2 lit.
                    a DSGVO or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO and <br>
                    (2) the processing is carried out with the aid of automated procedures.</p>
                <p>In exercising this right, you also have the right to have the personal data concerning you
                    transferred directly from one controller to another controller, insofar as this is technically
                    feasible. This must not affect the freedoms and rights of other persons.</p>
                <p>The right to data portability does not apply to the processing of personal data necessary for the
                    performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
                    vested in the controller. <br>
                    7. Right to object</p>
                <p>You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the
                    processing of personal data concerning you which is carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(e) or
                    (f) DSGVO; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions.</p>
                <p>The controller shall no longer process the personal data concerning you unless it can demonstrate
                    compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and
                    freedoms, or the processing serves the purpose of asserting, exercising, or defending legal claims.
                </p>
                <p>If the personal data concerning you is processed for the purposes of direct marketing, you have the
                    right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purposes of
                    such marketing; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is related to such direct marketing.
                </p>
                <p>If you object to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data concerning you will
                    no longer be processed for these purposes.</p>
                <p>You have the possibility, in connection with the use of information society services, notwithstanding
                    Directive 2002/58/EC, to exercise your right to object by means of automated procedures using
                    technical specifications.</p>
                <p>You also have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the
                    processing of personal data concerning you which is carried out for scientific or historical
                    research purposes or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR.</p>
                <p>Your right to object may be limited to the extent that it is likely to render impossible or seriously
                    impair the realization of the research or statistical purposes and the restriction is necessary for
                    the fulfillment of the research or statistical purposes. <br>
                    8. Right to revoke your declaration of consent under data protection law</p>
                <p>You have the right to revoke your declaration of consent under data protection law at any time. The
                    revocation of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of
                    the consent until the revocation. <br>
                    9. Automated decision in individual cases including profiling</p>
                <p>You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing – including
                    profiling – which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. This
                    does not apply if the decision</p>
                <p>(1) is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between you and the controller, <br>
                    (2) is permissible on the basis of legal provisions of the Union or the Member States to which the
                    controller is subject and these legal provisions contain appropriate measures to safeguard your
                    rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests; or <br>
                    (3) is made with your express consent.</p>
                <p>However, these decisions may not be based on special categories of personal data pursuant to Article
                    9(1) of the GDPR, unless Article 9(2)(a) or (g) of the GDPR applies and appropriate measures have
                    been taken to protect the rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests.</p>
                <p>With regard to the cases referred to in (1) and (3), the controller shall take reasonable steps to
                    safeguard the rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests, including at least the right
                    to obtain the intervention of a person on the part of the controller, to express your point of view
                    and to contest the decision. <br>
                    10. Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</p>
                <p>Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a
                    complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your residence, place
                    of work or the place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of personal
                    data concerning you infringes the GDPR.</p>
                <p>The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant of the
                    status and outcome of the complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy under Article 78
                    GDPR.</p>
