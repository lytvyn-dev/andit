                            <p class="services-item__text text">For most IT applications, it is cheaper to close
                                security gaps during the architecture phase rather than patching a system later in
                                operation. This applies in particular to complex IT applications. Many security problems
                                cannot be corrected later because they affect the architecture. Therefore, we analyze
                                the structure and architecture of your application at an early stage to establish an
                                attack-resistant structure. anbit makes sure that you use secure technologies at every
                                stage of development - during development, deployment and operation. We also help you
                                use the right development stacks and tools, deployment tools and operating systems.

                            <p class="services-item__text text">With our Static application security testing you can
                                protect your systems by detecting security vulnerabilities in the source code. We detect
                                the typical vulnerabilities like injection (e.g. LDAP or SQL), buffer overflows and
                                cross-site scripting. A big advantage is that you can analyze your source code for
                                vulnerabilities very early, even before the source code is finalized. By discovering
                                vulnerabilities early, we can easily and immediately adjust the code. Therefore you
                                avoid rework and save significant costs.

                                Containers are an indispensable component for various DevOps concepts. Container
                                solutions from anbit establish cloud-native development of applications. We use open
                                source programs such as Kubernetes and Docker for this purpose. We also facilitate the
                                open hybrid cloud approach and bundle the advantages of private cloud, public cloud and
                                local IT infrastructure. Containers are compact, scalable and cost-effective. In
                                addition, containers are portable and work more efficiently because they require fewer
                                resources than virtual machines, move between environments, and can be set up and scaled
                                quickly.
